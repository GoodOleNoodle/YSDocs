## **Welcome to Yarn Spinner 2.0!**

Yarn Spinner is a system for building interactive conversations in games. Yarn Spinner is made up of two things:

1. Yarn files that contain the script for your game, and;
2. The Yarn Spinner framework for your chosen game engine or method of delivery.

**This documentation is still in active development.** If you see an issue, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YSDocs/issues/new). This documentation is for Yarn Spinner 2.0. There are not equivalents for all the documentation that was present for Yarn Spinner 1.0, and certain pages are empty or have not yet been finished.
{% endhint %}

**To use Yarn Spinner 2.0, you will need:**

1. **An editor to write and edit .yarn scripts with.** We recommend using the official Yarn Spinner Visual Studio Code extension, together with Visual Studio Code.
   * You can find details on installing VS Code and the official Yarn Spinner Visual Studio Code Extension here: [editing-with-vs-code](getting-started/editing-with-vs-code/ "mention")
2. **A copy of Yarn Spinner for your game engine of choice.** Currently, Yarn Spinner supports Unity, so you'll need Yarn Spinner Unity.
   * You can learn more about Yarn Spinner Unity here: [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
3. **A .yarn script (or a few of them).** These will be the narrative, or bits of narrative, that Yarn Spinner uses to display and deliver your dialogue.
   * You can learn more about writing in Yarn here: [writing-in-yarn](getting-started/writing-in-yarn/ "mention")

{% hint style="danger" %}
Yarn Spinner currently only officially supports Unity. There are community projects for other game engines, and we're officially working on more. Stay tuned for updates.
