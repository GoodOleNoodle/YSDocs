# Yarn Spinner Documentation

This repository contains the GitBook source code used on the [Yarn Spinner documentation site](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev).

The [`gitbook` branch](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YSDocs/tree/gitbook) populates the content on the main documentation site. The [`staging` branch](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YSDocs/tree/staging) populates the content on [the documentation's staging site](http://yarn-spinner.gitbook.io/staging).

In order to make sure that the main documentation site always refers to the most recent release, new changes to the documentation should go to `staging`, and be merged to `gitbook` when a release is performed.
