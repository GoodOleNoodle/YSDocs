**Welcome to Yarn Spinner 2.0!**&#x20;

Yarn Spinner is a system for building interactive conversations in games.

Yarn Spinner is made up of two things:&#x20;

1. Yarn files that contain the script for your game, and;
2. The Yarn Spinner framework for your chosen game engine or method of delivery.&#x20;

If you already have Yarn scripts, or know how to write them, you'll then need to know about how to hook them up to your game engine of choice.

* To learn how to **write dialogue in Yarn**, begin with [**Writing Your Dialogue**](broken-reference).
* To use **Yarn Spinner with Unity**, begin at [**Working with Unity**](using-yarnspinner-with-unity/overview.md).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Yarn Spinner currently only officially supports Unity. There are community projects for other game engines, and we're officially working on more. Stay tuned for updates.
