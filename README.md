**Welcome to Yarn Spinner!** Yarn Spinner is a system for building interactive conversations in games.

Yarn Spinner is made up of two things: Yarn files that contain the script for your game, and the Yarn Spinner framework for your chosen game engine or method of delivery. To learn how to **write Yarn scripts**, begin at [**Writing Your Dialogue**](broken-reference).

If you already have Yarn scripts, or know how to write them, you'll then need to know about how to hook them up to your game engine of choice.

* To learn how to **write dialogue in Yarn**, begin with [**Writing Your Dialogue**](broken-reference).
* To use **Yarn Spinner with Unity**, begin at [**Working with Unity**](using-yarnspinner-with-unity/overview.md).
