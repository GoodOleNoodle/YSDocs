  Learn about Line View, a Dialogue View that displays a single line of dialogue
  on a Canvas.

# Line View

Line View is a [Dialogue View](./) that displays a single line of dialogue inside a Unity UI canvas. When the Dialogue Runner encounters a line in your Yarn Script, the Line View will display it, wait for the user to indicate they're done reading it, and then dismiss it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Line View only displays lines, and doesn't display options. You can use an additional Dialogue View to handle these, like an [Options List View](options-list-view.md) or a custom Dialogue View of your own.
{% endhint %}

### Showing the Character's Name

If a line contains a character's name at the start, Line View can be configured to show the name in a separate text view to the line text itself. If the Character Name Text property is connected to a TextMeshPro Text object, then the character's name will appear in this object.

If you don't attach a Text object to the Character Name Text property, you can choose to either show the character name as part of the line (that is, in the Line Text view), or don't show it all.

### Presenting Lines with Visual Effects

Line View can be configured to use visual effects when presenting lines.

* You can choose to have the Line View fade in when a line appears, and fade out when the line is dismissed.
* You can choose to have the text of the line appear, one letter at a time, with a "typewriter" effect.

### Continuing to the Next Line

You can control how the player can decide to proceed to the next line.

You can set up a Button, or any other Unity UI control, to call the OnContinueClicked method on this line.

You can also make the Line View continue to the next line when the user performs some input:

* If you set the Continue Action Type to Key Code, you can select a key on the keyboard that will continue to the next line on press.
* If you set the Continue Action Type to Input Action, you can create an Action from an input device (such as from a keyboard, gamepad, or other method).
* If you set the Continue action Type to Input Action from Asset, you can attach an Action from an Input Actions asset that you've set up elsewhere.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use Input Actions, your project will need to be set up to use the new [Unity Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.2/manual/index.html).

| Use Fade Effect                  | If this is turned on, the Line View will fade the opacity of the Canvas Group from 0% to 100% opacity when lines appear, and fade back to 0% when lines are dismissed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fade In Time                     | The duration of the Fade effect when fading a new line in, in seconds.

| Use Typewriter Effect            | If this is turned on, the text of the line will appear one character at a time. This will take place after the Fade effect, if enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| On Character Typed               | A Unity Event that's called every time the Typewriter effect displays new text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Typewriter Effect Speed          | The number of characters per second to display when performing a Typewrite effect.
