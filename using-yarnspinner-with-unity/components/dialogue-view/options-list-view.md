# Options List View

Options List View is a Dialogue View that presents a list of options in a list.

{% hint style="info" %}
Options List View only displays options, and doesn't display lines. You can use an additional Dialogue View to handle these, like a [Line View](line-view.md) or a custom Dialogue View of your own.
{% endhint %}
