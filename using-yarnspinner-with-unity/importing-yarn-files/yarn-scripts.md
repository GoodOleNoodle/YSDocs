# Yarn Scripts

A Yarn script is a text file containing your dialogue.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

The new file that you've just created will contain a single [node](../../getting-started/writing-in-yarn/lines-nodes-and-options.md#writing-nodes-in-plain-text), which has the same name as the file.

## Editing Yarn Scripts

To edit a Yarn script, double-click it in Unity.  The file will open in your editor. When you save your changes and return to Unity, it will be re-compiled.
