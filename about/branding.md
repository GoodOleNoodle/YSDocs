There are two parts to crediting Yarn Spinner: what you're **required** to do if you use Yarn Spinner, and, optionally, what we'd **appreciate** you doing.

### What You're Required To Do

Yarn Spinner is provided to you under the terms of the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). This means that if you use Yarn Spinner in a game, software, or any other work, you are **required** to include a copy of Yarn Spinner's license in that work.

You can find a copy of [Yarn Spinner's license on GitHub](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/main/LICENSE.md). It's also included in the packaged versions of Yarn Spinner (such as via the Unity Package Manager.)

You can choose how you'd like to include a copy of this in your game, and there's no firm rules. We have some suggestions, though:

* on a screen in your game, along with other software licenses
* in a file that lists all licenses related to your game
* in an accompanying PDF, or similar, electronic manual or documentation

Basically, as long as a copy of Yarn Spinner's version of the MIT license is distributed with your game, you're good to go.

### What We'd Appreciate You Doing

In addition to including a copy of the Yarn Spinner's MIT license in your game, we'd very much appreciate it if you include Yarn Spinner in your game's credits, such as the initial splash screen, or in your end-game credits, or somewhere else of your chosing.

If you credit Yarn Spinner, you can use the logo, a text credit, or both.

If you use a text credit, we suggest the following:

> Dialogue powered by Yarn Spinner, by Secret Lab. https://yarnspinner.dev

(You can reword this however you'd like, but we'd prefer if you kept the terms 'Yarn Spinner', 'Secret Lab', and the link to the website.)

Yarn SpinnerÂ® is a trademark of Secret Lab Pty Ltd in Australia. For the purposes of crediting Yarn Spinner, acknowleding that you're using Yarn Spinner, or discussing, teaching, or tutorialising Yarn Spinner and other simlar uses, you are permitted to use the Yarn Spinner name and logo on packaging, promotional/advertising materials, splash screens, in publications, seminars,  conference talks, and web sites.&#x20;

When doing so, you should do your best adhere to the following general guidelines:

1. Yarn Spinner cannot be part of a product name unless we have given you explicit and specific permission (just email us, we're friendly);
2. Yarn Spinner is being used in a referential manner or alongside a referential phrase (e.g. "built with", "uses", "compatible with", "teaches", "learns");
3. The game, or project that you're including the Yarn Spinner trademark on does, in fact, work with, use, or relate to Yarn Spinner;
4. The use of the Yarn Spinner trademark does not imply endorsement, sponsorhip, or a inaccurate representation of the relationship between you, your game or project, and the Yarn Spinner project or Secret Lab Pty Ltd;
5. The use of the Yarn Spinner trademark does not show Yarn Spinner or Secret Lab Pty Ltd in an false or derogatory manner.
