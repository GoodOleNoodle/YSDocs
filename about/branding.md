## How To Credit Yarn Spinner

There are two parts to crediting Yarn Spinner: what you're **required** to do if you use Yarn Spinner, and, optionally, what we'd **appreciate** you doing.

### What You're Required To Do

Yarn Spinner is provided to you under the terms of the MIT License. This means that if you use Yarn Spinner in a game, software, or any other work, you are **required** to include a copy of Yarn Spinner's license in that work. 

This can be in a screen in your game, a file on disk that the user can open, or otherwise distributed with the work.

You can find a copy of [Yarn Spinner's license on GitHub](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/main/LICENSE.md). It's also included in the packaged versions of Yarn Spinner (such as via the Unity Package Manager.)

### What We'd Appreciate You Doing

In addition to including a copy of the Yarn Spinner license in your game, we'd very much appreciate it if you include Yarn Spinner in your game's credits (such as the initial splash screen, or in your end-game credits.)

If you credit Yarn Spinner, you can use the logo, a text credit, or both.

If you use a text credit, we suggest the following:

> Dialogue powered by Yarn Spinner, by Secret Lab. https://yarnspinner.dev

(You can reword this however you'd like, but we'd prefer if you kept the terms 'Yarn Spinner', 'Secret Lab', and the link to the website.)

## Using the Yarn Spinner brand

You may use the Yarn Spinner brand to credit Yarn Spinner in your game (or other work), as long as it conforms to our brand guidelines. 

You may not edit, modify, distort, recolour, or change the Yarn Spinner logo.

You can download the Yarn Spinner logo, in a variety of formats, here.
