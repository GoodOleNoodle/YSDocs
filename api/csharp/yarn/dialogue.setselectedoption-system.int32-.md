# Dialogue.SetSelectedOption Method

Signals to the [`Dialogue`](/api/csharp/yarn/dialogue.md) that the user has
selected a specified [`OptionSet.Option`](/api/csharp/yarn/optionset.option.md).


```csharp
public void SetSelectedOption(int selectedOptionID)
```
## Remarks

After the Dialogue delivers an [`OptionSet`](/api/csharp/yarn/optionset.md), this
method must be called before [`Continue()`](/api/csharp/yarn/dialogue.continue.md) is called.

The ID number that should be passed as the parameter to this
method should be the [`ID`](/api/csharp/yarn/optionset.option.id.md) field in
the [`OptionSet.Option`](/api/csharp/yarn/optionset.option.md) that represents the user's
selection.
