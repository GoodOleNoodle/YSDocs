# DialogueViewBase.NodeComplete Method

Called by the [`DialogueRunner`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialoguerunner.md) to signal that the
end of a node has been reached.


```csharp
public virtual void NodeComplete(string nextNode, Action onComplete)
```
## Remarks

This method may be called multiple times before [`DialogueComplete()`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueviewbase.dialoguecomplete.md) is called. If this method returns
<see cref="!:Dialogue.HandlerExecutionType.ContinueExecution"></see>,
do not call the <code data-dev-comment-type="paramref" class="paramref">onComplete</code> method.

The default implementation does nothing.
