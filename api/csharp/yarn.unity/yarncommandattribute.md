# YarnCommandAttribute Class

An attribute that marks a method on a <see cref="!:MonoBehaviour"></see>
as a [command]( {{<ref
"/docs/unity/working-with-commands">}}).


```csharp
public class YarnCommandAttribute : System.Attribute
```
## Remarks

When a [`DialogueRunner`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialoguerunner.md) receives a <see cref="!:Command"></see>, and no command handler has been installed for the
command, it splits it by spaces, and then checks to see if the
second word, if any, is the name of any <see cref="!:GameObject"></see>s
in the scene. 

If one is found, it is checked to see if any of the
<see cref="!:MonoBehaviour"></see>s attached to the class has a [`YarnCommandAttribute`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/yarncommandattribute.md) whose [`CommandString`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/yarncommandattribute.commandstring.md) matching the first word
of the command.

If a method is found, its parameters are checked:

* If the method takes a single <see cref="!:System.String"></see>[] parameter,
the method is called, and will be passed an array containing all
words in the command after the first two.

* If the method takes a number of <see cref="!:System.String"></see> parameters
equal to the number of words in the command after the first two, it
will be called with those words as parameters.

* Otherwise, it will not be called, and a warning will be issued.

### `YarnCommand`s and Coroutines

This attribute may be attached to a coroutine. 

{{<note>}} The [`DialogueRunner`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialoguerunner.md) determines if the
method is a coroutine if the method returns <see cref="!:IEnumerator"></see>. {{</note>}}

If the method is a coroutine, the DialogueRunner will pause
execution until the coroutine ends.

## Example


The following C# code uses the `YarnCommand` attribute to register
commands.


```csharp 
class ExampleBehaviour : MonoBehaviour {
   [YarnCommand("jump")] 
   void Jump()
   {
       Debug.Log($"{this.gameObject.name} is jumping!");
   }

   [YarnCommand("walk")] 
   void WalkToDestination(string destination) {
       Debug.Log($"{this.gameObject.name} is walking to {destination}!");
   }

   [YarnCommand("shine_flashlight")] 
   IEnumerator ShineFlashlight(string durationString) {
       float.TryParse(durationString, out var duration);
       Debug.Log($"{this.gameObject.name} is turning on the flashlight for {duration} seconds!");
       yield new WaitForSeconds(duration);
       Debug.Log($"{this.gameObject.name} is turning off the flashlight!");
   }
}
```


Next, assume that this `ExampleBehaviour` script has been attached
to a <see cref="!:GameObject"></see> present in the scene named "Mae". The
`Jump` and `WalkToDestination` methods may then be called from a
Yarn script like so:


```yarn 
// Call the Jump() method in the ExampleBehaviour on Mae
<<jump Mae>>

// Call the WalkToDestination() method in the ExampleBehaviour 
// on Mae, passing "targetPoint" as a parameter
<<walk Mae targetPoint>>

// Call the ShineFlashlight method, passing "0.5" as a parameter;
// dialogue will wait until the coroutine ends.
<<shine_flashlight Mae 0.5>>
```


Running this Yarn code will result in the following text being
logged to the Console:

``` 
Mae is jumping! 
Mae is walking to targetPoint! 
Mae is turning on the flashlight for 0.5 seconds!
(... 0.5 seconds elapse ...)
Mae is turning off the flashlight!
```
