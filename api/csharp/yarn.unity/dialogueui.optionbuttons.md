# DialogueUI.optionButtons Field

The buttons that let the user choose an option.


```csharp
public List<Button> optionButtons
```
## Remarks

The <see cref="!:Button"></see> objects in this list will be enabled
and disabled by the [`DialogueUI`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.md). Each button
should have as a child object a <see cref="!:Text"></see> or a <see cref="!:TMPro.TextMeshProUGUI"></see> as a label; the text of this
child object will be updated by the DialogueUI as necessary.

You do not need to configure the On Click action of any of
these buttons. The [`DialogueUI`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.md) will configure them
for you.
