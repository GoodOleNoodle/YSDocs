# DialogueViewBase.OnLineStatusChanged Method

Called by the DialogueRunner to indicate that the line that
this view is delivering has changed state.


```csharp
public abstract void OnLineStatusChanged(LocalizedLine dialogueLine)
```
## Remarks

Subclasses of [`DialogueViewBase`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueviewbase.md) should override
this method to be notified when a line has become interrupted,
and when the line has finished being delivered by all views.

The default implementation does nothing.
