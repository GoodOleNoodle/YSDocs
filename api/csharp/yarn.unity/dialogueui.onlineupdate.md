# DialogueUI.onLineUpdate Field

A [`DialogueRunner.StringUnityEvent`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialoguerunner.stringunityevent.md) that is called
when the visible part of the line's localised text changes.


```csharp
public DialogueRunner.StringUnityEvent onLineUpdate
```
## Remarks

The <see cref="!:System.String"></see> parameter that this event receives is
the text that should be displayed to the user. Use this method
to display line text to the user.

The [`DialogueUI`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.md) class gradually reveals the
localised text of the <see cref="!:Line"></see>, at a rate of [`textSpeed`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.textspeed.md) seconds per character. [`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md) will be called multiple times, each time
with more text; the final call to [`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md)
will have the entire text of the line.

If the line's Status becomes [`Interrupted`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/linestatus.interrupted.md), which indicates
that the user has requested that the Dialogue UI skip to the
end of the line,
[`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md) will be called once more, to display
the entire text.

If [`textSpeed`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.textspeed.md) is `0`, [`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md)
will be called just once, to display the entire text all at
once.

After the final call to [`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md), [`onTextFinishDisplaying`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.ontextfinishdisplaying.md) will be called to indicate that
the line has finished appearing, followed by [`onLineFinishDisplaying`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlinefinishdisplaying.md).
