# Interrupted

The line got interrupted while being build up and should complete showing the line asap. View classes should get to the end of the line as fast as possible. A view class showing text would stop building up the text and immediately show the entire line and a view class playing voice over clips would do a very quick fade out and stop playback afterwards.

```csharp
Interrupted = 1
```
