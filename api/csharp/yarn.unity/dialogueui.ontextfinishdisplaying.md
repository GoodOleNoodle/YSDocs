# DialogueUI.onTextFinishDisplaying Field

A <see cref="!:UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent"></see> that is called
when the line has finished being displayed by this view.


```csharp
public UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent onTextFinishDisplaying
```
## Remarks

This method is called after [`onLineUpdate`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlineupdate.md). Use
this method to display UI elements like a "continue" button. 

If there are multiple views displaying this line, this method
may be called some time before [`onLineFinishDisplaying`](/api/csharp/yarn.unity/dialogueui.onlinefinishdisplaying.md)
is called.
