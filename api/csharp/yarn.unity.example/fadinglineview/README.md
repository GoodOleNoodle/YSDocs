# FadingLineView

A dialogue view that presents lines in a  component, and options in a vertical list. The text fades in from transparency when delivering a line, and fades out when the line is complete. Each character can have a custom colour to use. In addition, pressing the Spacebar key will skip the line.

```csharp
public class FadingLineView : DialogueViewBase
```
